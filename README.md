# exercism-solutions

Exercism is an awesome website that provides a multitude of code exercises for many different languages. The difference between exercism and many other code-learning websites is that exercism focuses on TDD and requires you to run your code locally on your own machine. The benefit of this, is that you learn how to set up your machine and also learn how to set up your environment to run the examples. This is where I'm storing those examples.

To clone this down, we need to take care to place it in the correct location and with everything in the submodules initialized.
